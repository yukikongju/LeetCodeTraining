[NeetCode 150](https://neetcode.io/practice)

## Tips

**Questions to answer**

1. Explain the algorithm, time and space complexity, alternative, ...
2. Ask yourself follow up questions
3. Frame the question in a real world context

**How to effectively study**

1. Pick a new problem pattern: sliding window, DFS+DP, monotonic stack, ...
2. Check problem resolution for that type of problem
3. Solve that problem by looking at the code template once
4. Solve a bunch of problems following that patterns without looking at answers
