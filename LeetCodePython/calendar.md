# Calendar - Patterns and problems I solved by date

Aug 17, 2023:
    - [X] Decreasing Monotonic Stack
	    * Next Greatest Number I/II

Aug 19, 2023:
    - [X] DFS + Stack:
	    * Buy and Sell Stock I/II/III/IV

Aug 20, 2023:
    - [X] Binary Search:
	    * Mountain Array

Aug 26, 2023:
    - [X] BFS+MinHeap:
	* Swim in Rising Water
	* Cheapest Flights Within K Stops
    - [X] Dijkstra
	* Network Delay Time
	* Path With Minimum Effort

Aug 27, 2023:
    - [X] MinHeap
	* Find Kth largest element in array
    - [X] Prim's Algorithm - minHeap
	* Min Cost to Connect All Points
    - [X] Greedy
	* Find Valid Matrix Given Row and Column Sums
	* Reconstruct 2-Row Binary Matrix

Aug 28, 2023:
    - [X] Greedy + Stack
	* Remove K Digits 
	* Minimum Swaps to Make String Balanced

Aug 30, 2023:
    - [X] Balanced Stack -> only add if balanced > 0 ; remove excess afterward
	* Minimum Remove to Make Valid Parentheses

Sep 03, 2023:
    - [X] String Replace && Balanced Stack
	* Minimum Insertions to Balance a Parentheses String
	* Check if a Parentheses String Can Be Valid => forward and backward pass
