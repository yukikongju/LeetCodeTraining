# Pattern - Graph

- Graph Traversal Algorithms:
    * Using various graph traversal algorithms such as depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS) to explore the graph.
    * Common problems: "Number of Islands," "Word Ladder."

- Topological Sorting:
    * Determining a linear ordering of the vertices of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge (u, v), vertex u comes before vertex v.
    * Common problems: "Course Schedule," "Alien Dictionary."

- Connected Components and Union-Find:
    * Identifying and managing connected components in a graph using union-find (disjoint set) data structures.
    * Common problems: "Number of Connected Components in an Undirected Graph," "Redundant Connection."

- Shortest Path Algorithms:
    * Applying algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm or Bellman-Ford algorithm to find the shortest paths in weighted graphs.
    * Common problems: "Cheapest Flights Within K Stops," "Network Delay Time."

- Minimum Spanning Tree:
    * Finding the minimum spanning tree of a graph using algorithms like Prim's or Kruskal's algorithm.
    * Common problems: "Minimum Spanning Tree," "Optimize Water Distribution in a Village."

- Graph Coloring:
    * Assigning colors to vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.
    * Common problems: "Is Graph Bipartite?", "Course Schedule II."

- Eulerian Path and Cycle:
    * Finding an Eulerian path or cycle in a graph, visiting all edges exactly once.
    * Common problems: "Eulerian Path," "Find the Town Judge."

- Articulation Points and Bridges:
    * Identifying articulation points (cut vertices) and bridges (cut edges) in an undirected graph.
    * Common problems: "Critical Connections in a Network," "Find Critical and Pseudo-Critical Edges in Minimum Spanning Tree."

- Strongly Connected Components:
    * Identifying and managing strongly connected components in a directed graph using algorithms like Tarjan's or Kosaraju's.
    * Common problems: "Strongly Connected Components," "Redundant Connection II."

- Bipartite Graph Check:
    * Determining if a given graph is bipartite or can be partitioned into two sets such that no two nodes in the same set are adjacent.
    * Common problems: "Is Graph Bipartite?", "Possible Bipartition."

- Directed Graph Analysis:
    * Analyzing properties of directed graphs such as cycle detection, reachability, or transitive closure.
    * Common problems: "Find the Town Judge," "Redundant Connection II."

- Graph Decomposition and Transformations:
    * Decomposing a graph into subgraphs or transforming graph problems into more manageable forms.
    * Common problems: "Optimize Water Distribution in a Village," "Evaluate Division."
