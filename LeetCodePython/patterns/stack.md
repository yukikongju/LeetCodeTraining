# Pattern - Stack

- Basic Stack Operations:
    * Utilizing the fundamental stack operations of push, pop, and peek.
    * Common problems: "Valid Parentheses," "Implement Stack using Queues."

- Minimum or Maximum Stack:
    * Extending the basic stack operations to support constant-time retrieval of minimum or maximum elements.
    * Common problems: "Min Stack," "Largest Rectangle in Histogram."

- Monotonic Stack:
    * Maintaining a monotonically increasing or decreasing order within the stack.
    * Common problems: "Daily Temperatures," "Next Greater Element II."

- Two Stacks for Functionality:
    * Using two stacks to implement specific functionality or operations.
    * Common problems: "Queue using Stacks," "Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation."

- Expression Parsing and Evaluation:
    * Parsing and evaluating expressions using stacks for operator precedence.
    * Common problems: "Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation," "Basic Calculator II."

- Tracking Indices and Positions:
    * Using stacks to track indices or positions for various purposes.
    * Common problems: "Remove Duplicate Letters," "Decode String."

- Balanced Parentheses and Brackets:
    * Solving problems related to checking balanced parentheses or brackets.
    * Common problems: "Valid Parentheses," "Longest Valid Parentheses."

- Depth and Nesting Level:
    * Using stacks to track depth or nesting level of elements.
    * Common problems: "Maximum Nesting Depth of Two Valid Parentheses Strings."

- Postfix Notation (Reverse Polish Notation):
    * Solving problems related to postfix notation using stacks.
    * Common problems: "Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation," "Basic Calculator II."

- Window or Sliding Window Operations:
    * Using stacks to manage elements within a window or sliding window.
    * Common problems: "Sliding Window Maximum," "Remove All Adjacent Duplicates In String."

- Reversal Using Stack:
    * Reversing elements using a stack.
    * Common problems: "Reverse String," "Reverse Linked List."

- Undo or Rollback Operations:
    * Using stacks to implement undo or rollback operations.
    * Common problems: "Online Stock Span," "Maximal Rectangle."
