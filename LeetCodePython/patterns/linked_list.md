# Pattern - Linked List

- Traversal and Iteration:
    * Iterating through the linked list while considering different directions (forward or backward).
    * Common problems: "Reverse Linked List," "Palindrome Linked List."

- Two Pointers Approach:
    * Using two pointers to traverse the linked list with different speeds or positions.
    * Common problems: "Linked List Cycle," "Intersection of Two Linked Lists."

- Fast and Slow Pointers:
    * Using a fast pointer and a slow pointer to find a middle point or detect cycles.
    * Common problems: "Middle of the Linked List," "Happy Number."

- Dummy Nodes and Sentinel Nodes:
    * Introducing dummy or sentinel nodes to simplify edge cases or insertions.
    * Common problems: "Remove Nth Node From End of List," "Merge Two Sorted Lists."

- In-place Reversal:
    * Reversing the linked list in-place by modifying the next pointers.
    * Common problems: "Reverse Linked List," "Swap Nodes in Pairs."

- Partitioning or Segregation:
    * Partitioning elements in the linked list based on certain criteria.
    * Common problems: "Partition List," "Odd Even Linked List."

- Intersection and Merge:
    * Finding the intersection point of two linked lists or merging two sorted linked lists.
    * Common problems: "Intersection of Two Linked Lists," "Merge Two Sorted Lists."

- Cyclic and Non-cyclic Detection:
    * Detecting whether a linked list contains a cycle or is non-cyclic.
    * Common problems: "Linked List Cycle," "Linked List Cycle II."

- Merge Sort and Divide-and-Conquer:
    * Applying merge sort or divide-and-conquer techniques on linked lists.
    * Common problems: "Sort List," "Split Linked List in Parts."

- Cloning and Copying:
    * Cloning or copying linked lists while preserving certain relationships.
    * Common problems: "Copy List with Random Pointer," "Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List."

- Palindromic Properties:
    * Solving problems involving checking if a linked list is palindrome.
    * Common problems: "Palindrome Linked List," "Palindrome Linked List II."

- Cycle Detection and Removal:
    * Detecting cycles and removing them from the linked list.
    * Common problems: "Linked List Cycle II," "Convert Binary Number in a Linked List to Integer."
