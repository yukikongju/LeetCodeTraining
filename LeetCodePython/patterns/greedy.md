# Patterns - Greedy

- Interval Scheduling:
    * This subpattern involves selecting a subset of intervals to maximize some objective while avoiding overlaps.
    * Common problems: "Non-overlapping Intervals," "Meeting Rooms II," "Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons."

- [ ] Activity Selection:
    * Similar to interval scheduling, but often involves selecting a subset of activities to maximize a value or meet certain criteria.
    * Common problems: "Task Scheduler," "Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II," "Queue Reconstruction by Height."

- Huffman Coding:
    * Involves constructing an optimal binary tree for data compression, where frequently used symbols have shorter codes.
    * Common problems: Problems related to encoding and decoding, custom data compression algorithms.

- [ ] Greedy with Sorting:
    * This subpattern combines the greedy approach with sorting the input data to simplify the problem-solving process.
    * Common problems: "Assign Cookies," "Reconstruct Itinerary," "Minimum Number of Taps to Open to Water a Garden."

- [ ] Greedy with Priority Queue:
    * Involves using a priority queue (heap) to efficiently select the best element among multiple options.
    * Common problems: "Kth Largest Element in an Array," "Top K Frequent Elements," "Find K Pairs with Smallest Sums."

- Greedy with Math:
    * Involves utilizing mathematical insights to solve problems in a more efficient and optimized way.
    * Common problems: "Jump Game II," "Divide Array in Sets of K Consecutive Numbers," "Gas Station."

- Greedy with Two Pointers:
    * This approach often requires maintaining two pointers and making decisions based on their positions.
    * Common problems: "Two Sum II - Input array is sorted," "Container With Most Water," "Remove Duplicate Letters."

- [ ] Greedy with Fixed Increment/Decrement:
    * Involves incrementing or decrementing values in a certain way to reach an optimal outcome.
    * Common problems: "Minimum Increment to Make Array Unique," "Advantage Shuffle," "Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee."

- [ ] Greedy with Global and Local Optima:
    * Balancing between choosing globally optimal actions and locally optimal actions in order to achieve the best overall result.
    * Common problems: "Jump Game," "Jump Game III," "Candy."

- Greedy with Multiple Conditions:
    * Solving problems where multiple conditions need to be satisfied in order to make a decision.
    * Common problems: "Non-decreasing Array," "Valid Parenthesis String," "Construct K Palindrome Strings."
