# Pattern - Backtracking

- Simple Recursive Backtracking:
    * This is the basic form of backtracking where you explore all possible options by recursively branching and undoing choices.
    * Common problems: "Permutations," "Combinations," "Subsets."

- Backtracking with Constraints:
    * Involves applying constraints to the choices you make during backtracking to reduce the search space.
    * Common problems: "N-Queens," "Combination Sum," "Word Break II."

- Backtracking with Memoization:
    * Enhances backtracking by storing intermediate results to avoid redundant computations.
    * Common problems: "Fibonacci Number" (using memoization), "Regular Expression Matching."

- Backtracking with Pruning:
    * Involves early termination of certain branches of the search tree that are guaranteed not to yield valid solutions.
    * Common problems: "Word Search," "Combination Sum II," "Generate Parentheses."

- Permutation and Combination Backtracking:
    * Specialized backtracking subpatterns for generating permutations and combinations.
    * Common problems: "Permutations," "Combinations," "Subsets."

- Board or Grid Exploration:
    * Involves navigating through a board or grid while respecting certain rules and constraints.
    * Common problems: "Sudoku Solver," "N-Queens," "Word Search."

- Decision Tree Construction:
    * Constructing a decision tree where each level represents a decision or choice.
    * Common problems: "Letter Combinations of a Phone Number," "Restore IP Addresses."

- Backtracking with Back-to-Back Decisions:
    * Involves making a series of decisions in sequence and then backtracking if a certain condition is not met.
    * Common problems: "Restore IP Addresses," "Word Break II."

- Backtracking with Multiple Variables:
    * Handling multiple variables or elements during the backtracking process.
    * Common problems: "Combination Sum," "Word Break II," "Subsets II."

- Backtracking with Ordered Choices:
    * Making choices in a specific order to avoid duplicates or ensure a certain ordering.
    * Common problems: "Combination Sum II," "Subsets II," "Permutations II."

- Backtracking with Extra Data Structures:
    * Utilizing additional data structures (e.g., hash sets, maps) to optimize or assist in the backtracking process.
    * Common problems: "Word Break II," "Word Search II," "Combination Sum II."

- Backtracking with Variable Constraints:
    * Problems where the constraints on choices change dynamically as the backtracking process progresses.
    * Common problems: "N-Queens," "Combination Sum," "Word Search II."
