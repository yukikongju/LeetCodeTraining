# Pattern - Intervals 
    
- Merge Intervals:
    * Combining overlapping or adjacent intervals to create larger intervals.
    * Common problems: "Merge Intervals," "Insert Interval," "Meeting Rooms II."

- Overlapping Intervals:
    * Identifying and handling intervals that overlap with each other.
    * Common problems: "Meeting Rooms," "Non-overlapping Intervals," "Find the Right Interval."

- Interval Intersection:
    * Finding intersections between two sets of intervals.
    * Common problems: "Interval List Intersections," "Employee Free Time."

- Interval Union:
    * Calculating the union of overlapping intervals.
    * Common problems: "Interval List Union," "Range Module."

- Interval Partitioning:
    * Partitioning intervals into non-overlapping groups.
    * Common problems: "Partition Labels," "Insert Interval."

- Interval Coverage:
    * Determining the coverage or range of intervals.
    * Common problems: "Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons," "Meeting Rooms II."

- Interval Insertion or Deletion:
    * Inserting or deleting intervals while maintaining a certain property.
    * Common problems: "Range Module," "Range Addition II."

- Interval Difference:
    * Computing the difference between intervals or ranges.
    * Common problems: "Range Module," "My Calendar III."

- Interval Overlaps and Gaps:
    * Analyzing overlaps and gaps between intervals.
    * Common problems: "My Calendar I," "Remove Covered Intervals."

- Sweep Line Technique:
    * Using a sweep line to track events or changes in intervals.
    * Common problems: "Meeting Rooms II," "My Calendar I."

- Interval Sorting:
    * Sorting intervals based on start or end points for efficient processing.
    * Common problems: "Merge Intervals," "Insert Interval."

- Interval Compression:
    * Reducing a set of overlapping intervals into a compressed form.
    * Common problems: "Remove Covered Intervals," "Maximum Frequency Stack."
