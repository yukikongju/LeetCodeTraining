# Pattern - Binary Search 
    
- Standard Binary Search:
    * The basic binary search algorithm where you repeatedly divide the search interval in half.
    * Common problems: "Search in Rotated Sorted Array," "Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array."

- Binary Search with Unique Properties:
    * Binary search problems where the array or sequence has unique properties, leading to a modified binary search.
    * Common problems: "Peak Index in a Mountain Array," "Guess Number Higher or Lower."

- Searching for Target Value or Closest Value:
    * Binary search can be used to find the exact target value or the closest value to the target.
    * Common problems: "Search Insert Position," "Find K Closest Elements."

- Binary Search for Minimum or Maximum Value:
    * Involves using binary search to find the minimum or maximum value that satisfies certain conditions.
    * Common problems: "Minimize Maximum Pair Sum in Array," "Split Array Largest Sum."

- Binary Search with Sorted and Rotated Array:
    * Solving problems where the array is sorted but rotated, requiring modified binary search techniques.
    * Common problems: "Search in Rotated Sorted Array," "Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array."

- Binary Search with Invariant Conditions:
    * Utilizing binary search to maintain specific invariants during the search process.
    * Common problems: "Search for a Range," "Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array."

- Binary Search with Infinite Arrays:
    * Solving problems where the array is considered infinite, requiring special binary search techniques.
    * Common problems: "Search in a Sorted Infinite Array," "Search in a 2D Matrix II."

- Binary Search with Partially Sorted Arrays:
    * Solving problems where the array is partially sorted, leading to variations in the binary search approach.
    * Common problems: "Search in Rotated Sorted Array," "Median of Two Sorted Arrays."

- Binary Search with Bit Manipulation:
    * Applying binary search along with bit manipulation to solve specific problems.
    * Common problems: "Find the Duplicate Number," "Single Element in a Sorted Array."

- Binary Search with Math and Conditions:
    * Combining binary search with mathematical insights and certain conditions to optimize solutions.
    * Common problems: "Search a 2D Matrix," "Pow(x, n)."

- Binary Search with Multi-dimensional Arrays:
    * Solving problems that involve searching in multi-dimensional arrays using binary search techniques.
    * Common problems: "Search a 2D Matrix," "Search a 2D Matrix II."
