# Pattern - Heap 
    
- Min Heap and Max Heap:
    * Using a min heap to maintain the smallest element at the root and a max heap to maintain the largest element at the root.
    * Common problems: "Kth Largest Element in an Array," "Find Median from Data Stream."

- Priority Queue with Custom Comparators:
    * Using a priority queue with custom comparators to maintain elements based on specific criteria.
    * Common problems: "K Closest Points to Origin," "Top K Frequent Elements."

- Heap with Hash Map:
    * Combining a heap with a hash map to efficiently track elements' frequency or presence.
    * Common problems: "Top K Frequent Elements," "Merge k Sorted Lists."

- Heap with Index Mapping:
    * Using an index mapping to keep track of original element positions in the heap.
    * Common problems: "Sort Characters By Frequency," "Sliding Window Maximum."

- Heap with Delayed Operations:
    * Delaying certain operations on heap elements to optimize efficiency.
    * Common problems: "Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix," "Ugly Number II."

- Merging Multiple Heaps:
    * Merging or combining multiple heaps to achieve desired operations.
    * Common problems: "Merge k Sorted Lists," "Super Ugly Number."

- Heap with Interval Merging:
    * Using a heap to merge overlapping or adjacent intervals efficiently.
    * Common problems: "Merge Intervals," "Employee Free Time."

- Heap with Topological Sort:
    * Using a heap in topological sorting to select nodes with specific properties.
    * Common problems: "Course Schedule III," "Reorganize String."

- Heap with Expiry Time:
    * Managing elements with an associated expiry time or duration.
    * Common problems: "Design Twitter," "Design Hit Counter."

- Heap with Greedy Algorithms:
    * Combining heap operations with greedy algorithms to solve problems.
    * Common problems: "Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons," "Reorganize String."

- Heap with Window Operations:
    * Using a heap to manage elements within a sliding window.
    * Common problems: "Sliding Window Maximum," "Find Median from Data Stream."

- Heap with Multi-dimensional Data:
    * Handling multi-dimensional data using heap data structures.
    * Common problems: "Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix," "Kth Smallest Prime Fraction."
