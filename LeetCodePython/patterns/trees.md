# Pattern - Trees

- Traversal Algorithms:
    * Different traversal algorithms (pre-order, in-order, post-order, level-order) to visit tree nodes.
    * Common problems: "Binary Tree Inorder Traversal," "Binary Tree Level Order Traversal."

- Recursion and Divide-and-Conquer:
    * Using recursive methods to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems.
    * Common problems: "Maximum Depth of Binary Tree," "Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree."

- Depth-First Search (DFS):
    * Traversing a tree by going as deep as possible before backtracking.
    * Common problems: "Sum Root to Leaf Numbers," "Binary Tree Paths."

- Breadth-First Search (BFS):
    * Traversing a tree level by level, visiting all nodes at the same level before moving to the next level.
    * Common problems: "Average of Levels in Binary Tree," "Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node."

- Binary Search Tree (BST) Properties:
    * Exploiting properties of binary search trees (ordered nodes) to solve problems.
    * Common problems: "Validate Binary Search Tree," "Kth Smallest Element in a BST."

- Balanced Trees:
    * Solving problems related to balanced trees (e.g., AVL, Red-Black trees).
    * Common problems: "Balanced Binary Tree," "Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree."

- Trie or Prefix Tree:
    * Problems involving trie data structures for efficient string manipulation.
    * Common problems: "Implement Trie (Prefix Tree)," "Word Search II."

- Binary Tree Construction and Conversion:
    * Constructing and converting between different binary tree forms.
    * Common problems: "Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal," "Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree."

- Tree Manipulation and Transformation:
    * Transforming trees or modifying their structure.
    * Common problems: "Invert Binary Tree," "Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List."

- Tree Traversal Iteration:
    * Using iteration and stacks/queues to perform tree traversals.
    * Common problems: "Binary Tree Inorder Traversal," "Binary Tree Level Order Traversal."

- Binary Heap or Priority Queue:
    * Solving problems using binary heaps or priority queues in tree structures.
    * Common problems: "Kth Largest Element in a Stream," "Merge k Sorted Lists."

- Graph to Tree Conversion:
    * Converting graph problems to tree-like structures to solve them efficiently.
    * Common problems: "Redundant Connection," "Minimum Height Trees."

## Minimum Height Trees

Intuition: remove leaves iteratively
