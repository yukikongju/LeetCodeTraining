# Pattern - Dynamic Programming
    
- Memoization and Tabulation:
    * Memoization involves storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing them when the same inputs occur again.
    * Tabulation involves building a table from the bottom up and storing intermediate results to avoid redundant calculations.
    * Common problems: "Fibonacci Number," "Climbing Stairs," "Coin Change."

- Top-Down Recursion with Memoization:
    * Involves breaking down the problem into subproblems and solving them recursively while storing the results in a memoization table.
    * Common problems: "Longest Increasing Subsequence," "Edit Distance," "Word Break."

- Bottom-Up Tabulation:
    * Involves building a solution iteratively by solving smaller subproblems first and using their results to solve larger ones.
    * Common problems: "Minimum Path Sum," "Unique Paths," "House Robber."

- 1D and 2D Arrays:
    * Many dynamic programming problems involve using arrays to store and update solutions for different states.
    * Common problems: "Longest Palindromic Substring," "Maximum Subarray," "Longest Common Subsequence."

- Matrix Chain Multiplication:
    * This is a specific type of dynamic programming problem where you find the optimal way to multiply a sequence of matrices.
    * Common problems: "Matrix Chain Multiplication," "Palindrome Partitioning II."

- Knapsack Problems:
    * These problems involve optimizing the use of limited resources to achieve the maximum or minimum value.
    * 0-1 Knapsack: Common problems include "Partition Equal Subset Sum," "Target Sum."
    * Unbounded Knapsack: Common problems include "Coin Change," "Maximum Sum Circular Subarray."

- LIS and LCS Variations:
    * Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) and Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) are foundational DP problems with many variations.
    * Common problems: "Russian Doll Envelopes" (LIS variation), "Shortest Common Supersequence" (LCS variation).

- Grid and Matrix Problems:
    * Dynamic programming can be used to solve problems on grids or matrices.
    * Common problems: "Minimum Path Sum," "Unique Paths," "Cherry Pickup."

- Partitioning Problems:
    * Involves breaking a problem into smaller subproblems and finding optimal partitions.
    * Common problems: "Palindrome Partitioning," "Partition Equal Subset Sum," "Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III."

- Sequence Alignment and Edit Distance:
    * Solving problems related to aligning sequences with the minimum number of edits or changes.
    * Common problems: "Edit Distance," "Minimum ASCII Delete Sum for Two Strings."

- Range Queries:
    * Involves solving problems where you need to query information about a range in an array or sequence.
    * Common problems: "Range Sum Query 2D - Immutable," "Maximum Subarray Sum with One Deletion."

- DP on Trees:
    * Solving dynamic programming problems where the underlying structure is a tree.
    * Common problems: "House Robber III" (Binary Tree), "Diameter of Binary Tree."
