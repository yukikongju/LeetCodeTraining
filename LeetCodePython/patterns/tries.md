# Pattern - Trie

- Trie Construction:
    * Building a trie data structure from a given set of words or strings.
    * Common problems: "Implement Trie," "Word Dictionary," "Concatenated Words."

- Trie Search:
    * Searching for words or prefixes in a trie data structure.
    * Common problems: "Implement Trie (Prefix Tree)," "Search in a 2D Matrix II."

- Trie Insertion with Data:
    * Inserting words into a trie while associating additional data with each word.
    * Common problems: "Map Sum Pairs," "Design In-Memory File System."

- Trie with Wildcard Matching:
    * Modifying the trie to handle wildcard characters for more flexible searching.
    * Common problems: "Add and Search Word - Data structure design," "Word Search II."

- Trie with Constraints:
    * Solving problems where trie nodes need to satisfy certain conditions or constraints.
    * Common problems: "Replace Words," "Design Search Autocomplete System."

- Trie with Backtracking:
    * Combining trie structures with backtracking techniques to solve problems.
    * Common problems: "Word Search II," "Design Search Autocomplete System."

- Trie with Frequency Counting:
    * Extending the trie to store and manage frequency counts of words.
    * Common problems: "Top K Frequent Words," "Design Search Autocomplete System."

- Trie with Minimum XOR:
    * Using trie to find the minimum XOR value between a given number and numbers in an array.
    * Common problems: "Maximum XOR of Two Numbers in an Array," "Minimum XOR Sum of Two Arrays."

- Trie with Bit Manipulation:
    * Modifying trie operations to take advantage of bitwise operations.
    * Common problems: "Maximum XOR of Two Numbers in an Array," "Maximum XOR with an Element From Array."

- Trie with Suffixes and Prefixes:
    * Extending the trie to support searching for common prefixes or suffixes.
    * Common problems: "Longest Common Prefix," "Short Encoding of Words."

- Trie with Dynamic Updates:
    * Updating a trie structure as new words are inserted or deleted.
    * Common problems: "Stream of Characters," "Design In-Memory File System."

- Trie with Multiple Children Data:
    * Associating multiple data values with each node in the trie.
    * Common problems: "Design Search Autocomplete System," "Map Sum Pairs."
