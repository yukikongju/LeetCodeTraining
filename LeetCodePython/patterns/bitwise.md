# Pattern - Bitwise Operations

- Bitwise AND, OR, XOR:
    * Applying bitwise AND, OR, and XOR operations to integers.
    * Common use cases: Clearing specific bits, setting specific bits, toggling bits.

- Bitwise Shifts:
    * Shifting bits to the left (<<) or right (>>) to perform multiplication or division by powers of 2.
    * Common use cases: Efficient multiplication or division, extracting or inserting fields.

- Single Bit Manipulation:
    * Working with individual bits and their positions in an integer.
    * Common use cases: Checking if a bit is set, setting a specific bit, toggling a bit.

- Counting Bits:
    * Counting the number of set bits (1s) in an integer.
    * Common use cases: Computing the Hamming weight, populating a lookup table.

- Finding Unique Element:
    * Finding a unique element in an array where all other elements appear twice.
    * Common use cases: "Single Number," "Single Number II."

- Bit Manipulation with Masks:
    * Applying masks to isolate specific bits or ranges of bits.
    * Common use cases: Extracting a subfield, isolating certain bits, creating masks.

- Bitwise Tricks:
    * Using bitwise operations to perform certain mathematical operations more efficiently.
    * Common use cases: Swapping two values, finding the absolute value.

- Bitwise Operations in Set Representation:
    * Using bitwise operations to represent sets or subsets of elements efficiently.
    * Common use cases: Implementing a bitset, finding power sets.

- Bitwise Operations with Flags:
    * Using flags and bitwise operations to manage state or options.
    * Common use cases: Enumerating options, checking state conditions.

- Bitwise Operations in Hashing:
    * Utilizing bitwise operations to design custom hashing functions.
    * Common use cases: Hashing integers, optimizing hash functions.

- Bitwise Operations with Masks and Patterns:
    * Utilizing specific masks or patterns to identify certain characteristics.
    * Common use cases: Detecting power of two numbers, identifying patterns.

- Bitwise Operations in Bitboards (Chess and Games):
    * Using bitboards to represent game states and applying bitwise operations for optimizations.
    * Common use cases: Efficient game state representation, move generation.
