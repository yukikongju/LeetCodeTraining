# Greedy

🟩 1. Interval Scheduling (Classic Greedy)

Sort by end time or start time — the ultimate greedy pattern.

✔ Must-Solve

Non-overlapping Intervals (erase minimum)

Meeting Rooms

Meeting Rooms II

Interval Scheduling Maximization

Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons

Merge Intervals

Insert Interval

Car Pooling (sweep line)

Employee Free Time

Core Idea

Always pick the interval that ends earliest → leaves room for more.

🟦 2. Scheduling / Deadlines / Priority Queues

Greedy + heaps = classic interview questions.

✔ Must-Solve

Course Schedule III (minimize heap by course duration)

Minimum Number of Platforms

IPO (maximize capital with heap)

Task Scheduler (Greedy with PQ)

Reorganize String

Least Interval

Maximum Performance of a Team

K Closest Points to Origin

Core Idea

Sort tasks → use priority queue to maintain optimal current choices.

🟨 3. Sorting + Greedy

Sort items by a custom rule, then greedily process.

✔ Must-Solve

Largest Number (custom comparator)

Queue Reconstruction by Height

Minimum Absolute Difference Pairs

Hand of Straights (sort + hash)

Boat to Save People

Advantage Shuffle

Reorder Data in Log Files

Core Idea

Sorting enables a natural greedy choice.

🟥 4. Two Pointers + Greedy

Greedy movement from both ends.

✔ Must-Solve

Two City Scheduling

Gas Station

Boats to Save People

Container With Most Water

Trapping Rain Water (two-pointer greedy)

Candy (two passes)

Maximum Ice Cream Bars

Core Idea

Move pointers based on which side gives the greedy optimality.

🟪 5. Graph Greedy

Greedy applied on graph structures.

✔ Must-Solve

Network Delay Time (Dijkstra – greedy)

Minimum Spanning Tree (Kruskal, Prim)

Cheapest Flights Within K Stops (modified Dijkstra)

Path With Maximum Minimum Value (PQ greedy)

Core Idea

Always pick the next smallest/largest weight or best frontier.

🟫 6. Greedy with Math / Observations

When greedy is correct due to a mathematical invariant.

✔ Must-Solve

Jump Game

Jump Game II

Candy

Lemonade Change

Remove K Digits

Monotone Increasing Digits

Broken Calculator

Bulb Switcher IV (count transitions)

Core Idea

Greedy decision backed by monotonicity or parity.

🟧 7. Greedy with Strings & Stacks

Often combined with monotonic stacks.

✔ Must-Solve

Remove Duplicate Letters

Smallest Subsequence of Distinct Characters

Remove K Digits

Make The String Great

Partition Labels

Valid Parentheses with removal constraints

Core Idea

Maintain lexicographically smallest result while satisfying constraints.

🟰 8. Frequency-based Greedy

Greedy based on most frequent or least frequent elements.

✔ Must-Solve

Top K Frequent Elements

Sort Characters by Frequency

Task Scheduler

Reorganize String

Kth Largest Element in a Stream (PQ)

Core Idea

Pick highest/lowest freq items greedily.

🟦 9. Greedy with Sliding Window

Greedy choices inside a window to maintain constraints.

✔ Must-Solve

Longest Repeating Character Replacement

Fruits into Baskets (max 2 types)

Minimum Size Subarray Sum

Max Consecutive Ones III

Core Idea

Expand window greedily until invalid, then shrink.

🟣 10. Hard/Advanced Greedy

These appear in senior interviews & FAANG screens.

✔ Must-Solve

Jump Game II

Reconstruct Itinerary (Hierholzer—but greedy lexicographically)

Split Array into Fibonacci Sequence

Minimum Number of Refueling Stops

Divide Chocolate

Tallest Billboard (DP + greedy intuition)
