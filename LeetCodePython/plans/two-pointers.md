# Two Pointers

🟩 1. Classic Two Sum / Pair Sum

Find pairs in sorted or unsorted arrays.

✔ Must-Solve

Two Sum II – Input Array Is Sorted

Two Sum (unsorted with hash map)

3Sum

3Sum Closest

4Sum

Core Pattern

Sort array if unsorted

Use left and right pointers moving towards each other

Skip duplicates if needed

🟦 2. Subarray / Subsequence Sum

Problems where you need sums or sliding window.

✔ Must-Solve

Subarray Sum Equals K (sliding window / hash)

Minimum Size Subarray Sum

Maximum Sum of Subarray of Size K

Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Longest Subarray with At Most K Distinct / Sum ≤ Target

Core Pattern

Maintain window [left, right]

Expand right, shrink left when condition violated

🟥 3. Container / Trapping / Rainwater

Geometrical or physical intuition problems.

✔ Must-Solve

Container With Most Water

Trapping Rain Water

Trapping Rain Water II (2D / priority queue variant)

Rain Water Trapped in Histogram

Core Pattern

Maintain pointers at both ends

Greedy choice of pointer with smaller height

🟨 4. Linked List Two-Pointers

Classic slow/fast pointer techniques.

✔ Must-Solve

Linked List Cycle Detection (Floyd’s Cycle)

Linked List Cycle II

Remove Nth Node From End of List

Middle of Linked List

Palindrome Linked List

Reorder List

Core Pattern

Slow / Fast pointer for cycle detection

Maintain gap of N for Nth node removal

Reverse second half for palindrome check

🟪 5. Sliding Window / Strings

Two pointers on strings or arrays for substring problems.

✔ Must-Solve

Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Minimum Window Substring

Permutation in String

Longest Repeating Character Replacement

Sliding Window Maximum

Core Pattern

Expand right pointer

Shrink left to maintain constraint

Use hashmap / counter for tracking

🟫 6. Partition / Sorting / Dutch National Flag

Separate elements or rearrange array in-place.

✔ Must-Solve

Sort Colors

Move Zeroes

Partition Array

Three Sum / Four Sum (use two-pointer after sorting)

Squares of a Sorted Array

Core Pattern

Two pointers at ends or adjacent

Swap elements to correct position

🟧 7. Interval / Merging / Overlaps

Problems with ranges or merging intervals.

✔ Must-Solve

Merge Intervals

Meeting Rooms / Meeting Rooms II

Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons

Non-overlapping Intervals

Interval List Intersections

Core Pattern

Sort intervals by start / end

Two pointers track active intervals

Merge or skip depending on overlap

🟦 8. Matrix / 2D Two-Pointers

Problems in 2D space that can be reduced to 1D via two pointers.

✔ Must-Solve

Search a 2D Matrix
