# SOLUTION: DFS
# optim1: 3 cases => on split le probl√®me en 2

# Solution 1: Brute-Force
# Explanation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYPwYz-rAmM
#       We try every subproblems: we can move if 
#           (1) board[i] == 'o'
#           (2) board[i+1] == 'o'
#           (3) board[i+2] == '-'
#       We can use a hashmap to store computed values

# Solution 2:
