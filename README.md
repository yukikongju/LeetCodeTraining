## Learning Data Structure and Algorithms

#### Step #1: Data Structure

When learning about data structure, we need to understand:

- How the Operations Works: Insertion, Suppression, Search
- Time and Space Complexity of Operations: best vs worst vs average case
- How the ADT is implemented: properties, invariant, helper methods, ...

List of Abstract Data Type:
- Data Types: Dynamic Array vs Linked List
- Basic Abstract Data Type: Bag, Stack , Queue
- Sorting Algorithms: Insertion, Selection Sort, Mergesort, quicksort, heapsort, radix sort
- Heaps
- (Optional) Trie, Splay Tree, Treaps
- Binary Search Tree
- Self-Balancing Trees: AVL, Red-Black Trees, B-Trees
- HashTable: Separate Chaining vs Open Adressing

#### Step #2: Graph Theory

- Graph Representation: adjacency list, edge list, adjacency matrix
- Common Problems in Graph Theory: connectivity, minimum spanning tree,
  shortest path, coloring, ...
- Common Algorithms: Prim's, Kruskal's, Dijsktra, Ford-Fulkerson, A*, ...

#### Step #3: Learn Algorithms Patterns

Although one can jump into algorithms pattern first, I find that having
a good background in data structure and graph theory makes learning better
since we have the tool to think about the problem rather than learning its
solution. I think the best bet is to do the following leetcode questions
and use Youtube whenever I get stuck
