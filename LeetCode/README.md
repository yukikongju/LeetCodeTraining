## [Strategies](#strategies)

#### Arrays

- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window Technique
- Expand from Center

#### Linked List

- Fast and Slow pointers (walker-runner)
- Catching Up: to make two linked list of different length sync in at the same position, link shortest node onto head of the longest when we hit a null and vice-versa
- Recursion

#### Trees and Graphs

- DFS/BFS

#### Backtracking

#### Dynamic Programming

- Kadane's Algorithm/Fibonacci: save recursion in 2 variables
- 0/1 Knapsack (bounded dp): we can take each element only once
- Bounded Knapsack:
- Unbounded Knapsack: we can take each element an infinite number of time
