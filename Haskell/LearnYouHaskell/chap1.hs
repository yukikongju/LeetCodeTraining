-- [> | Implement a function that takes two numbers and finds sum of their squares.

>>> sumOfSquares x y = x*x + y*y

-- [> | Implement a function that returns the last digit of a given number.

>>> lastDigit x = mod x 10

-- [> | Write a function that takes three numbers and returns the difference between the biggest number and the smallest one.

>>> minmax x y z =
    let list = [x, y, z]
     in maximum(list) - minimum(list)
