## Exercices


**1.1 Getting Started**

- [X] Exercice 1-1: Run the "he11o, world" program on your system. Experiment with leaving out parts of the program to see what error messages you get
- [X] Exercice 1-2: Experiment to find out what happens when printf s argument string contains \c, where c is some character not listed above

**1.2 Variables and Arithmetic Expressions**

- [X] Exercice 1-3: Modify the temperature conversion program to print a heading above the table (convert fahr to celsius)
    - [X] 3a: celsius is an int
    - [X] 3b: celsius is a float
- [X] Exercice 1-4: Write a program to print the corresponding Celsius to Fahrenheit table

**1.3 The For Statement**

- [X] Exercice 1-5: Modify the temperature conversion program to print the table using a for loop
    - [X] 5a: from 0 to 300
    - [X] 5b: from 300 to 0
