# Chap 1: A Tutorial Introduction

## What did we learn

- [X] Float and String formatting when printing with `printf()`
- [X] For and while loop
- [X] Constant should be in CAPS per convention
- [ ] 


## Exercices


**1.1 Getting Started**

- [X] Exercice 1-1: Run the "he11o, world" program on your system. Experiment with leaving out parts of the program to see what error messages you get
- [X] Exercice 1-2: Experiment to find out what happens when printf s argument string contains \c, where c is some character not listed above

**1.2 Variables and Arithmetic Expressions**

- [X] Exercice 1-3: Modify the temperature conversion program to print a heading above the table (convert fahr to celsius)
    - [X] 3a: celsius is an int
    - [X] 3b: celsius is a float
- [X] Exercice 1-4: Write a program to print the corresponding Celsius to Fahrenheit table

**1.3 The For Statement**

- [X] Exercice 1-5: Modify the temperature conversion program to print the table using a for loop
    - [X] 5a: from 0 to 300
    - [X] 5b: from 300 to 0

**1.4 Symbolic Constants**


**1.5 Character Input and Output**

- [ ] Exercice 1-6: Verify that the expression `getchar() != EOF` if 0 or 1
- [X] Exercice 1-7: Write a program to print the value of EOF
- [X] Exercice 1-8: Write a program to count blanks, tab, and new lines (fixme)
- [X] Exercice 1-9: Write a program to copy its input to its output, replacing each string of one or more blanks by a single blank
- [ ] Exercice 1-10: Write a program to copy its input to its output, replacing each tab by \t , each backspace by \b, and each backslash by \\ . This makes tabs and backspaces visible in an unambiguous way
- [ ] Exercice 1-11: How would you test the word count program? What kinds of input are most likely to uncover bugs if there are any?
- [ ] Exercice 1-12: Write a program that prints its input one word per line

**1.6 Arrays**

- [ ] Exercice 1-13: Write a program to print a histogram of the lengths of words in its input. It is easy to draw the histogram with the bars horizontal; a vertical orientation is more challenging.
    - [ ] 13a: horizontal
    - [ ] 13b: vertical
- [ ] Exercice 1-14: Write a program to print a histogram of the frequencies of different_ characters
in its input .

**1.7 Functions**

- [X] Exercice 1-15: Rewrite the temperature conversion program of Section 1.2 to use a function for conversion (see 5.c)
- [ ] Exercice 1-16: Revise the main routine of the longest-line program so it will correctly print the length of arbitrarily long input lines. and as much as possible of the text.
- [ ] Exercice 1-17: Write a program to print all input lines that are longer than 80 characters.
- [ ] Exercice 1-18: Write a program to remove trailing blanks and tabs from each line of input, and to delete entirely blank lines.
- [X] Exercice 1-19: Write a function `reverse()` that reverses the character string.  Use it to write a program that reverses its input a line at a time.

- [ ] Exercice 1-23: 
- [ ] Exercice 1-24:
