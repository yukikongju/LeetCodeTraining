# Chap 2 - Types, Operators and Expressions


**2.1. Variable Names**


**2.2. Data Types and Sizes**

- [X] Exercice 2-1: Write a program to determine the ranges of char, short, int and 
      long variables, both for signed and unsigned

**2.3. Constants**

**2.4. Declarations**

**2.5. Arithmetic Operators**

**2.6. Relational and Logical Operators**

- [X] Exercice 2-2: Write a loop equivalent to the for loop above without && and ||

**2.7. Type Conversions**

- [ ] Exercice 2-3: Write the funciton htoi(s) which converts a string of 
      hexadecimal digits (including an optional 0x) into its equivalent integer 
      value

**2.8. Increment and Decrement Operators**

- [ ] Exercice 2-4: Write an alternate version of squeeze(s1, s2), that deletes each character in s1 that matches any character in the string s2
- [ ] Exercice 2-5: Write the function any(s1, s2), which returns the first location in the string s1 where any character from the string s2 occurs, or -1 if s1 contains no characters from s2.

**2.9. Bitwise Operators**

- [ ] Exercice 2-6: Write a function setbits(x, p, n, y) that returns x with the 
      n bits that begin at position p set to the rightmost n bits of y, leaving 
      the other bits unchanged.
- [ ] Exercice 2-7: Write a function invert(x, p, n) that returns x with the 
      n bits that begin at position p inverted (ie 1 changed into 0 and vice-versa),
      leaving the others unchanged
- [ ] Exercice 2-8: Write a runction rightrot(x, n) that returns the value of the 
      integer x rotated to rhe right by n bit positions


**2.10. Assignment Operators and Expressions**

- [ ] Exercice 2-9: In a two's complement number system, `x &= (x-1)` deletes 
      the rightmost 1-bit in x. Use this observation to write a faster 
      version of bit-count

**2.11. Conditional Expressions**

- [ ] Exercice 2-10: Rewrite the function lower, which converts upper case 
      letters to lower case with a conditional epreddion instead of if-else

**2.12. Precedence and Order of Evaluation**


**Custom Exercices**

- [X] Exercice A: Return length of a string
- [X] Exercice B: Check if year is leap
